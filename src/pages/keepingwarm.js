            This project presents a heated blanket for wheelchair users, powered by kinetic energy from the wheels' movement. A dynamo hub generates electricity as the wheels turn, charging a buffer battery that powers the blanket's carbon-fiber heating elements for up to 3 hours.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            The system is designed to maintain a temperature between 40-50Â°C, with the blanket made from durable, hypoallergenic, and waterproof polyester microfiber.
