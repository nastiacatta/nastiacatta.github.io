        The Exo Glove is a wearable technology designed to boost grip strength and reduce strain for women DIY enthusiasts and homeowners. 
        By focusing on ergonomic comfort and minimizing fatigue, the Exo Glove enables users to perform tasks requiring manual dexterity more effectively. 
        Addressing the gap in grip and upper body strength between men and women, the Exo Glove aims to empower women to handle home improvement tasks efficiently.
        The glove enhances grip strength using air pumps and soft robotics that curl the fingers upon contact with an object, providing a secure hold and deflating once the object is released. 
        It was developed using advanced soft robotics and ergonomic design principles. The glove is powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries providing up to eight hours of continuous use.
