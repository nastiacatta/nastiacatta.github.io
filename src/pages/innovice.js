        The project aims to address significant wastefulness in the furniture industry by targeting the inefficient management of discarded furniture. 
        The proposed solution includes developing an AI-powered platform that facilitates furniture repair, creating a concept for a damage scanner to expedite the fixing process. 
        This scanner, integrated into handheld devices, assists furniture repair workers by providing style, color, and pattern suggestions and comparing prices and dimensions of different products.

      <p className="text-lg mt-4">
        By integrating this technology into existing systems, such as handheld computers used in large furniture companies, the project aims to reduce manual errors in the repair process and enhance the skill set of employees involved in furniture repair. 
        Ultimately, the project aims to reduce waste and foster a circular economy by merging manual scanning and application functions into a single efficient device.
